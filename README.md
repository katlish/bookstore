# bookstore - MERN app

My home task that simulates bookstore app with sign-up/login module based on JWT token.

User can have admin or user role.

"Admin" role user will have an access to the Admin Panel page with CRUD actions (add new book/ see all books/ edit a book/ delete a book).\
"User" role user will be blocked to all Admin actions, but should be able to buy a book and see Purchase History.
